[Carlos Vives]
I'm not gonna do anything
Searching in the wounds of the past
I'm not gonna lose
I don't want to be kind of other side 
 
[Shakira]
Your way is not complicated
On a bicycle that takes you everywhere
 
[Carlos Vives]
A desperate Vallenato*
 
[Carlos Vives & Shakira]
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
[Shakira]
I can be happy
Relaxed walking among people
I love you like that
And I like you because you are different 
 
[Carlos Vives]
My way is not complicated
On a bicycle that takes you everywhere
A desperate Vallenato 
 
[Carlos Vives & Shakira]
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
[Carlos Vives]
She is the favorite, singing in the area
She moves on her hip like a ship on the waves
She has bare feet like a child who adores
 
And her hair is long, is a sun that seems like
She likes to be told that it is the girl, lola
She likes to be looked when she dances alone
She likes more the house, which don't pass the hours
She likes Barranquilla, she likes Barcelona 
 
[Shakira]
Take me, take me on your bicycle
Hear me, Carlos, take me on your bicycle
I want to travel around together that area
From Santa Maria to La Arenosa 
 
Take me, take me on your bicycle
For us to play ball and rag there in flip-flop
That if you show Pique someday the Tayrona
Later he won't want to leave for Barcelona 
 
[Carlos Vives]
My way is complicated
 
[Carlos Vives & Shakira]
On a bicycle that takes you everywhere
A desperate Vallenato
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
[Shakira]
Take me, take me on your bicycle
Hear me, Carlos, take me on your bicycle
That if you show Pique someday the Tayrona
Later he won't want to leave for Barcelona 
 
Take me, take me on your bicycle
Hear me, Carlos, take me on your bicycle
That if you show Pique someday the Tayrona
Later he won't want to leave for Barcelona
