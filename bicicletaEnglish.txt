I'm not gonna do anything
Searching in the wounds of the past
I'm not gonna lose
I don't want to be kind of other side 
 
Your way is not complicated
On a bicycle that takes you everywhere
 
A desperate Vallenato*
 
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
I can be happy
Relaxed walking among people
I love you like that
And I like you because you are different 
 
My way is not complicated
On a bicycle that takes you everywhere
A desperate Vallenato 
 
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you

She is the favorite, singing in the area
She moves on her hip like a ship on the waves
She has bare feet like a child who adores
 
And her hair is long, is a sun that seems like
She likes to be told that it is the girl, lola
She likes to be looked when she dances alone
She likes more the house, which don't pass the hours
She likes Barranquilla, she likes Barcelona 
 
Take me, take me on your bicycle
Hear me, Carlos, take me on your bicycle
I want to travel around together that area
From Santa Maria to La Arenosa 
 
Take me, take me on your bicycle
For us to play ball and rag there in flip-flop
That if you show Pique someday the Tayrona
Later he won't want to leave for Barcelona 
 
My way is complicated
 
On a bicycle that takes you everywhere
A desperate Vallenato
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
A small letter that I keep where I wrote
That you dream and that I love you so much
That while my heart is
Beating for you, beating for you
 
Take me, take me on your bicycle
Hear me, Carlos, take me on your bicycle
That if you show Pique someday the Tayrona
Later he won't want to leave for Barcelona 
 
Take me, take me on your bicycle
Hear me, Carlos, take me on your bicycle
That if you show Pique someday the Tayrona
Later he won't want to leave for Barcelona
